#1. Git and GitHub#
1.1 The course How to use Git and GitHub
*GitHub is a completely new thing for me:)
*I'm surprised in branching and merging, and using cherry-pick at least.
*I'm sure that I will definitely use committs, push and pull request and all another cool features of Git.
1.2 Try.github.io
*This training was more difficult for me, especially rebasing.
*I'm sure that in future will use all flexibility of Git
